      <p>
        If you can reach agreement with the other parent or carer, then you do not need to go back to court to change
        your arrangements. However, a court can only enforce the child arrangements that are in your court order.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you have prohibited steps order or a specific issue order</h2>
      <p>
        Check any legal documents sent to you by a judge to see whether you have a prohibited steps order or a specific
        issue order (section 8).
      </p>

      <p>
        You must not try to change any rules given to you in a prohibited steps order or specific issue order. You can
        only propose changes to other parts of your child arrangements, such as what day of the week your children visit
        you.
