      <p class="govuk-body">You can write down what you've agreed in a 'child arrangements plan' if you want a record.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can use this service to help you plan and agree on child arrangements. It creates a document which you can share with the other parent to ask for their agreement and suggestions.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can also use the service with the other parent to make a plan together.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What the plan includes</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You'll need to provide details about how you plan to look after your children, such as:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>where they live</li>
        <li>when they spend time with each parent</li>
        <li>when and what other types of contact take place (phone calls, for example)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who can use this service</h2>

        <li>have no child arrangements in place yet</li>
        <li>want to suggest changes to your existing arrangements</li>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Who should not use this service</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should not use this service if you already have a court order that sets out child arrangements you and your ex-partner must follow. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/looking-after-children-divorce/apply-for-court-order" class="govuk-link">change or enforce an order</a> instead.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Make your plan</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">A legal adviser can help you make a legally binding agreement or recommend <a href="https://www.gov.uk/looking-after-children-divorce/non-court-dispute-resolution" class="govuk-link">other ways to agree on child arrangements</a> outside of court. They can also tell you how much it costs.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If you decide to go to court, you'll usually need to show you've tried <a href="https://www.gov.uk/looking-after-children-divorce/mediation" class="govuk-link">mediation</a> before you apply. You can usually get a voucher to pay for family mediation, regardless of what you earn.</p>

      <h2 id="legally-binding" class="govuk-heading-m">Making your agreement legally binding</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-a-legal-adviser" class="govuk-link">get a legal adviser</a> to draft a 'consent order' if you want a legally binding agreement.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">A consent order is a legal document that confirms your agreement.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You and your ex-partner both have to sign the draft consent order. You'll also need to get the consent order approved.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Get your consent order approved</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">You or your ex-partner need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/looking-after-children-divorce/apply-for-court-order" class="govuk-link">apply for a court order</a> to get your consent order approved. Your legal adviser can help you with your application.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You will not need to show that you've tried mediation.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Keep a copy of both the form and the draft consent order.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">After the court gets your paperwork</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">There's usually no court hearing. A judge will approve your consent order to make it legally binding if they think you've made decisions in your children's interest.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If the judge does not think your consent order is in your children's interest they can:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>change your consent order</li>
        <li>make a different court order to decide what's best for your children</li>
