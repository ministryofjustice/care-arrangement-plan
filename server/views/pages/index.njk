      <p>
        This service helps you and another parent or carer plan what arrangements are best for your children. If you can
        agree on a plan, you can avoid court.
      </p>
      <p>Use this service to propose:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>where your children live</li>
        <li>when your children spend time with each parent</li>
        <li>handovers, holidays and whatever else matters to your children</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You’ll end up with a proposed plan you can share with the other parent to ask their agreement.</p>

      <p>This service is useful if:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          you are separated or divorced from your children’s other parent and have no child arrangement plan in place
          yet
        </li>
        <li>you want to propose changes to your existing arrangements, even if you have a court order in place</li>
      </ul>

      {{
        govukButton({
          text: "Start now",
          isStartButton: true
        })
      }}

      <p>
        If you think the other parent is a threat to you or your children's safety, you should not use this service.
